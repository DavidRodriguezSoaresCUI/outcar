>>The app is functional.

>v1.0.1 : (11.08.2018)
>>Creation of this 'Changelog.txt' file.
>>The name of the database file was changed. This was motivated by a need to store multiple
  database files in a single location without name collision. A unique identifier was added
  at the end of the name.
>>Slight code cleanup in 'Send_database.java'. The email subject was modified, as the 'user ID'
  is redundant and can be changed.

>v1.0.2 (SP1) : (21.10.2018)
>>The 'Show Fuel Duration' bug was investigated, but the feature seems to work
>>The deprecated build.gradle commands that were triggering warnings at compile-time were
  replaced by their newer counterparts.

>v1.0.3 (SP1) : (01.11.2018)
>>Minor tutorial text changes
>>Tutorial: If there is no 'out of fuel penalty', then losing points due to
  not refueling isn't mentioned.
