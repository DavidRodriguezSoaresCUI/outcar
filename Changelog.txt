>>The app is functional.

>v1.0.1 : (11.08.2018)
>>Creation of this 'Changelog.txt' file.
>>The name of the database file was changed. This was motivated by a need to store multiple
  database files in a single location without name collision. A unique identifier was added
  at the end of the name.
>>Slight code cleanup in 'Send_database.java'. The email subject was modified, as the 'user ID'
  is redundant and can be changed.

>v1.0.2 (SP1) : (21.10.2018)
>>The 'Show Fuel Duration' bug was investigated, but the feature seems to work

  replaced by their newer counterparts.

  optimisation.

>v1.0.5 (SP1) : (10.11.2018)
>>A lot of code cleanup (C code mostly).
>>Some more getting accustomed to GitLab's environment (.gitignore and such).
>>Applied change: now the user-entered code can be as low as '1' (previously '1000'), and
  age/id-code bounds have been moved to 'res/values/integer.xml'.
>>Added a 'Todo' file, to keep track of what's left to do.

>v1.0.6 (SP1) : (25.11.2018)
>>Some code cleanup, mostly aesthetic to make the header files more readable.
>>New and improved way of displaying 'image_fx' on the screen

>>Now, when there is a point loss/gain, its value will scroll up (near the score box) in a visually
  pleasant way.
>>User interaction with the pause button is now logged as well.

>v1.0.7 (SP1) : (26.11.2018)

  present in the tutorial background.

  These are switches to modify key aspects of the game, along with the already-present
   'Display numeric clock'.

>>Added a 'release' folder where we'll put compiled ans signes APKs of each version.
