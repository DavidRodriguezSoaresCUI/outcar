# outcar

OutCar is a game developed for University of Geneva, for psychology studies. The game consists of avoiding traffic and refuelling periodically (just by pressing a button).

This game is still under active development as of Nov 2018.

**SP1** stands for *Service Pack 1*, for this is the first major update since the initial
release.


## Notes

* 'outcar' is the internal/developper name for this app. The user-visible name is 'Cal 
Cruiser'.
